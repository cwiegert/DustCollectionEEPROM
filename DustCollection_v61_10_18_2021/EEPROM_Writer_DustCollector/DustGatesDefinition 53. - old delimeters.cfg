/*****************************************************************************
*   This is the file that configures the parameters for the dust gates and machines.   
*    The delimeter is char(222) which is ascii extended table   the setup will read this file until it finds the 
*   delimeter, then start parsing the streams.  
*   
*   The special character to designate the end of the tool/gate section is char(246)  
*   To keep track of the configuration for the SD card - the pins are as follow
*   		VCC  -- power
*		GRD  -- Ground
*		MISO -- 50 
*		MOSI -- 51
*		SCK  -- 52
*		CS   -- 53
*
*   Setting up the PWM controller
*       VC+  --- 5v power
*       VCC  --- 5v Power
*       SDA  --- SDA on Mega
*       SCL  --- SCL on Mega
*       OE   --- <not connected>
*       GND  --- GND
*
*   NOTE:-->    a # at the beginning of the config lines below denotes a comment an inactive config.  Added this capability
*               to activate/deactivate stations during install/testing/expansion/reconfiguration.   There is no need to 
*               recompile code if you want to deactivate a servo or switch, it just needs to be comment or reconfigured
*
*  Config Notes:
*           Number_of_Tools is used when reading the section for the activations switches.   When setting the first 
*           line of the config below, the 2nd parameter sets the total number of tools in the system.  
*           There should be the equivalent number of lines for voltage monitoring switches
*
*   The last section of the config file is for setting up the Blynk wifi connectivity.  while we won't use this 
*   functionality very often, it's useful to be able to have a quick UI tool to control or diagnose issues, calibrate
*   the setup and gate parameters, without having to switch code in the arduino.   Likley we will have an integrated
*   and wifi mode for the code so we are not interfering with the normal set up of the integrated power monitory circuits
* 
*   Will need parameters for 
*           servoCount          
*           Number_of_tools  
*           Number_of_Gates
*           DC_Spindown --> Time to wait before turning off the dust collector motor
*           DustCollectionRelayPin
*           ManualSwitchPin
*           mVerPerAmp          -see below.   must divide parameter by 1000 
*           debounce
*           
*           
*   servos | tools | Gates | Dust collector delay | Dust Collector power | Manual gate | sensitivity | debounce| Debug
*
*          parsing token | gate # | pwmSlot | Name | open | close | gate switch map 
*
*          switch Id | name | analog pin | volt baseline | main Gate | Voltage supplied | ampThreshold
*   
*	float sensitivity[] ={
*          0.185,// for ACS712ELCTR-05B-T
*          0.100,// for ACS712ELCTR-20A-T
*          0.066// for ACS712ELCTR-30A-T

*
* v. 4.0.7.13.2020
*
*   version line written using char (131)  Latin small letter f with hook
*   this will end up in the version field on the Settings screen
*
*  IMPORTANT ==>   if you want to debug to the serial monitor, set the DEBUG argument to 1, and the code will post
*                   debug messages to the serial window.  0 == DEBUGGING OFF, 1 == DEBUGGING ON

^^    Next section is for configuring of gates
^^    every gate in teh system has to have a
^^    configuration line here, to make sure
^^    we know the settings on the servo
^^    Depending on your servo make, the pulse width min and max may vary, you 
^^      want these to be as small/large as possible without hitting the hard stop
^^      for max range. You'll have to tweak them as necessary to match the servos you have!
^^
^^   7/16/2020 - incremented all close positions by 10. worried about pegging 
^^		         the servos adn burining them out.  may need to move them to 
^^		         a smaller number to push them fully closed
^^   7/18/2020  -- the close position of the gates will be the pegging limit, the code
^^              will reverse 20 steps from that position so the servos are not held
^^              in a pegged position all the time
^^
^^              Also added the map to the specific PWM index for each servo.   Allows movememt of the 
^^              servos and doesn't require them to be plugged into the PWM in the exact order they appear
^^              in this config file.
